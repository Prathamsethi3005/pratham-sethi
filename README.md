# Activity program of 2024

|**Day 1**| On the first day of the induction program, we gathered in the auditorium to listen to lectures delivered by the principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, and the chief guests. It was a moment of pride as we learned about the renowned reputation of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College and its significant contributions across various sectors. Following the presentations, we had the opportunity to interact and I made a few friends. We also explored the expansive college campus, getting acquainted with its vastness.
